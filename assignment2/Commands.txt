PROBLEM1:
part1:
sqlite3 reuters.db "select count(*) from frequency where docid = '10398_txt_earn'"

part2:
SELECT count(term) 
   FROM frequency 
   WHERE docid = '10398_txt_earn' and count = 1 

part3:
SELECT count(term) 
   FROM (SELECT term FROM frequency WHERE docid = '10398_txt_earn' AND count = 
     1 UNION SELECT term From frequency WHERE docid = '925_txt_trade' AND count 
     = 1)

equivalent:
SELECT  count(DISTINCT term)  
  FROM frequency WHERE (docid = '10398_txt_earn' OR  docid = '925_txt_trade') 
       AND count = 1

part4:
SELECT  count(DISTINCT docid)  
   FROM frequency WHERE term = 'parliament'"

part5:
SELECT  count(x)  
  FROM (SELECT docid x, sum(count) y FROM frequency GROUP BY docid) 
  WHERE y > 300

equivalent:
SELECT  count(docid) 
  FROM (SELECT docid FROM frequency GROUP BY docid HAVING sum(count) > 300)

part6:
SELECT  count(DISTINCT x.docid)  
  FROM frequency x, frequency y 
  WHERE x.term = 'transactions' AND y.term = 'world' AND x.docid = y.docid

equivalent:
SELECT  count(DISTINCT x.docid)  FROM frequency x JOIN frequency y ON x.term = 'transactions' AND y.term = 'world' AND x.docid = y.docid

PROBLEM2: matrix multiplication

SELECT A.row_num, B.col_num, sum(A.value * B.value)
  FROM A,B
  WHERE A.col_num = B.row_num
  GROUP BY A.row_num, B.col_num
